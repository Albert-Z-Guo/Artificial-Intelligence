    - Problem files are recommended to be used with an online `.pddl` [editor](http://editor.planning.domains/#) to simulate robot pathing within Amazon warehouses.
    - Simply upload all of the files distributed using `File>Load`.
    - When you're ready to test, you can click `Solve`, select the domain and problem definitions that you'd like to use, and then click `Plan`. The system will run for a bit (for more complicated problems, upwards of ten seconds) and then give you the results.
